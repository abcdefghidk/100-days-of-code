# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 8, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Learned a bit of JavaScript. Attempted leetcode questions and touched up on binary Search.

**Thoughts:** I wasnt efficient at all. I got overwhelmed and kept changing plans. 

first, I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out where to start from. I wanted to solve basic problems and focus more on data structures and algorithms but I kept switching from topics to problems coz I got stuck at every question I tried. I surfed through freeCodeCamp and found helpful material but it was all in javascript and i really wanted to try it but I felt i didnt have much time to learn things again from the scratch coz I wanted to brush up on my concepts first so I switched to practice problems but I couldnt solve them. Then I switched to CodeWars and CodeChefs and found some easy problems that i felt i could solve but I got stuck again. It was very demotivating. I finally switched to Leetcode and decided to pick one topic to learn through a problem. I picked Binary Search and spent a lot of time trying to figure out the problem and implement it. In the end I got tired and coudlnt finish it.
